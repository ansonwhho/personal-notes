# Personal notes
These are personal notes, largely based on self-learning, and partly based on university courses. The main purpose of these notes is to help improve my own understanding, because teaching is a great way of learning! Hopefully youâ€™ll find these notes helpful, but bear in mind that they are by no means peer-reviewed - use them at your own risk! Note also that my ability to say anything intelligent may have been a lot lower in the past. If you spot any errors or have any comments about the content you can find my contact details on my main [blog](https://ansonwhho.github.io).
