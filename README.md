# St Andrews Notes
This repo contains physics and maths notes based on courses that I've taken at the University of St Andrews. While I've referred to external texts (course lecture notes, books, etc.), they are in written in my own words and are by no means a carbon copy of official resources. 

There will certainly be errors in the documents (typos, misconceptions, etc.), all of which are my own. Please use at your own risk!
