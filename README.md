# Personal notes
This repo contains my personal physics and maths notes, sometimes based on courses that I've taken at the University of St Andrews. While I've referred to external texts (course lecture notes, books, etc.), they are in written in my own words and are by no means a carbon copy of these other sources. Sources that I've referred to are typically listed at the beginning of each set of notes. 

There will certainly be errors in the documents (typos, misconceptions, etc.), all of which are my own. Please use at your own risk!
