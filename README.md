# University of St Andrews Physics Notes
This repo contains physics and maths notes based on courses I've taken at the University of St Andrews. The idea is to use these notes for practice explaining concepts, to improve my understanding, and to gain familiarity with LaTeX. I've based these off of lecture handouts, but they are by no means a carbon copy of them, and I've also referred to external sources for additional information. Sources that I've referred to are typically listed at the beginning of each set of notes. There will certainly be errors in the documents (typos, misconceptions, etc.) - these are my own, and not the mistakes of the course lecturers.
