## Overview
These are personal notes, largely based on self-learning, and partly based on university courses. The main purpose of these notes is to help improve my own understanding, because teaching is a great way of learning! Hopefully you'll find these notes helpful, but bear in mind that they are by no means peer-reviewed - use them at your own risk! Note also that my ability to say anything intelligent may have been a lot lower in the past. If you spot any errors or have any comments about the content you can find my contact details on my main [blog](https://ansonwhho.github.io). 

I usually make three types of posts: 
1. Notes from books and courses - I think *actively working* through books and courses is one of the best ways to learn, so this seems pretty important to me
2. Notes from papers - this is especially the case for AI, where the field is progressing so rapidly. I also do this to try and get a better idea of the motivations that researchers had when an idea was first discovered
3. Investigations - these start with something that I don't understand, then doing research until I feel sufficiently satisfied. These are the most likely to be wrong, but I also think they're the most interesting!
