## Overview
These are personal notes that I've written based on lecture notes and books that I've read, and courses that I've taken at the University of St Andrews (note however that these are not necessarily representative of what the courses are like). The main idea is to help improve my own understanding and to practise explaining concepts. 

The notes are typically contained in the form of individual posts about a particular topic, rather than as a full "course" (although this may sometimes be the case). There is no specified level of technical difficulty, and this can vary quite significantly between posts. I've also included recommended resources for further reading at the bottom of each article. 

Hopefully you'll find these notes helpful, but bear in mind that they are by no means peer-reviewed - use them at your own risk! If you spot any errors or have any comments about the content you can find my contact details on my main [blog](https://spectroscopycafe.github.io/).

There are three main categories of topics, which are themselves split into sub-topics. The way that the notes have been categorised can be debated, but I've just chosen to do so for the sake of organisation. Here is an overview of the notes that sections that are currently available: 

1. **Physics**
- Thermodynamics and statistical physics

2. **Mathematics**
- Analysis: Real analysis, complex analysis, harmonic analysis

3. **Computer Science**
- Artificial intelligence: Introduction to machine learning, reinforcement learning, and AGI
