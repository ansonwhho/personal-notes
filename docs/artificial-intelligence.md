# Artificial Intelligence
I think learning stuff in AI needs a different approach compared to physics or maths, because the field changes so quickly, and there is a lot less "established knowledge". This means reading more papers, which I try to do pretty often, and you can find my summaries of papers here: 
* [AI Papers #1: Concrete Problems in AI Safety](/personal-notes/2021/12/16/aip3-double-descent.html)
* [AI Papers #2: Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences](/personal-notes/2021/12/11/aip2-deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences.html)
* [AI Papers #3: Double Descent](/personal-notes/2021/12/16/aip3-double-descent.html)
